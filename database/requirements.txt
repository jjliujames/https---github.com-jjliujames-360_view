# Banking 360 Mockup Database Requirements
# Python dependencies for the SQLite database scripts

# Core dependencies (these are built into Python 3.6+)
# sqlite3 - Built into Python standard library
# pathlib - Built into Python 3.4+
# typing - Built into Python 3.5+

# No external dependencies required!
# All scripts use only Python standard library modules:
# - sqlite3 for database operations
# - pathlib for file path handling
# - typing for type hints
# - json for data serialization (if needed)
# - datetime for date/time handling

# To run the database scripts, you only need Python 3.6 or later.
# No pip install required!
